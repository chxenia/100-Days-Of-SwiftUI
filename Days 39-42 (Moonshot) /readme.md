# Challenge

* Add the launch date to MissionView, below the mission badge. You might choose to format this differently given that more space is available, but it’s down to you.
* Extract one or two pieces of view code into their own new SwiftUI views – the horizontal scroll view in MissionView is a great candidate, but if you followed my styling then you could also move the Rectangle dividers out too.
* For a tough challenge, add a toolbar item to ContentView that toggles between showing missions as a grid and as a list.

# Checkpoint 7

Make a class hierarchy for animals, starting with **Animal** at the top, then **Dog** and **Cat** as subclasses, then **Corgi** and **Poodle** as subclasses of **Dog**, and **Persian** and **Lion** as subclasses of **Cat**.

But there’s more:

1. The **Animal** class should have a **legs** integer property that tracks how many legs the animal has.
2. The **Dog** class should have a **speak()** method that prints a generic dog barking string, but each of the subclasses should print something slightly different.
3. The **Cat** class should have a matching **speak()** method, again with each subclass printing something different.
4. The **Cat** class should have an **isTame** Boolean property, provided using an initializer.
